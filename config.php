   * has filled the form.

   * two of them:
   *
   * 1. Add a textfield hidden via CSS. Ignore the submission if the form field
   *    is not empty.
   * 2. Add a hidden field via JavaScript. Ignore the submission if a value for
   *    the hidden field is missing (assumes that bots have JavaScript disabled).
   *
